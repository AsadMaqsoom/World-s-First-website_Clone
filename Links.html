    <title>Hypertext Terms</title>
</head>
<body>
    
<h1>Hypertext Terms</h1>
<p>This is a glossary of terms used within the <a href="">WWW</a> project. In most cases, their use corresponds to converntional use in hypertext circles.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Anchor</dt>
    <dd>An area within a the content of a <a href="">node</a> which is the source or destination of a <a href="">link</a> . The anchor may be the whole of the node content. Typically, clicking a mouse on an anchor area causes the link to be followed, leaving the anchor at the opposite end of the link displayed. Anchors tend to be highlighted in a special way (always, or when the mouse is over them), or represented by a special symbol. An anchor may, and often does, correspond to the whole node. (also sometimes known as "span", "region", "button", or "extent"). </dd>
<dt>Annotation</dt>
    <dd>The linking of a new commentary node to an existing <a href="">node</a>. If readers can annotate nodes, then they can immediately provide feedback if the information is misleading, out of date or plain wrong. Thus the quality of the information in the <a href="">web</a> can be improved. (<a href="">More</a>...) </dd>
<dt>Authoring</dt>
   <dd> A term for the process of writing a document. "Authoring" seems to have come into use in order to emphasise that document production involved more than just writing. </dd>
<dt>Back link</dt>
    <dd>A link in one direction implied from the existence of an explicit limk in the other direction. See: <a href="">Building back-links</a> </dd>
<dt>Browser</dt>
    <dd>A program which allows a <a href="">person</a> to read <a href="">hypertext</a> . The browser gives some means of viewing the contents of <a href="">nodes</a> , and of <a href="">navigating</a> from one node to another. </dd>
<dt>Button</dt>
    <dd>An <a href="">anchor</a> which is the source of a <a href="">link</a> . Often, but not always, represented on screen to look like a push-button. </dd>
<dt>Card</dt>
    <dd>An alternative term for a <a href="">node</a> in a system (e.g. HyperCard, Notecards) in which the node size is limited to a single page of a limited size.  </dd>
<dt>Client</dt>
    <dd>A program which requests services of another program. Normally, the <a href="">browser</a> is a client of a data server. </dd>
<dt>Database</dt>
    <dd>We have used this vaguely as a term for a collection of nodes . We imagine management information for one of these being kept in one place and all being accessible by the same server . Links outside this are "external", and those inside are "internal". We do not imply anything about how the information shored be stored. </dd>
<dt>Daemon</dt>
    <dd>A program which runs independently of, for example the browser . Daemons may perform various management tasks such as <a href="">building indexes</a>, overviews, and <a href="">back-links</a>. Under unix, "daemon" is used for " <a href="">server</a> ", because servers normally run independently. </dd>
<dt>Document</dt>
    <dd>A term for a <a href="">node</a> on some systems (eg Intermedia). Sometimes used by others as a term for a collection of nodes on related topics, possible stored or distributed as one. The prefered term in W3 documentation. </dd>
<dt>Domain</dt>
    <dd>We have used this specifically for a unit of protection. It could possibly correspond to a <a href="">database</a> , and in that case would be a better (less vague) term for it. </dd>
<dt>External</dt>
    <dd>A <a href="">link</a> to a <a href="">node</a> in a different database. See <a href="">Database</a> </dd>
<dt>Host</dt>
    <dd>A computer on a network. We use this term rather than the term " <a href="">node</a> " which is often used for a document in a hypertext <a href="">web</a> . </dd>
<dt>Hypermedia</dt>
    <dd>MultiMedia <a href="">Hypertext</a> . HyperMedia and HyperText tend to be used loosely in place of each other. Media other than text typically include graphics, sound, and video. (<a href="">More</a>...) </dd>
<dt>Hypertext</dt>
    <dd>Text which is not constrained to be linear. (<a href="">More</a>...) </dd>
<dt>Index</dt>
    <dd>Something which points at other data; a server facility which provides pointers to particular data as a function of a query;a table of contents of a book in hypertext form. ( More ).  </dd>
<dt>Internal</dt>
    <dd>A <a href="">link</a> to a <a href="">node</a> in the same <a href="">database</a> . See <a href="">database</a> . </dd>
<dt>Link</dt>
    <dd>A relationship between two <a href="">anchors</a> , stored in the same or different <a href="">database</a> . See <a href="">Internal</a> "" and "<a href="">External</a> " . </dd>
<dt>Navigation</dt>
    <dd>The process of moving from one <a href="">node</a> to another through the hypertext <a href="">web</a> . This is normally done by following <a href="">links</a> . Various features of a particular <a href="">browser</a> may make this easier. These include keeping a history of where the user has been, and drawing diagrams of links between nearby nodes. (<a href="">More</a>...) </dd>
<dt>Node</dt>
    <dd>A unit of information. Also known as a frame (KMS), card (Hypercard, Notecards). Used with this special meaning in hypertext circles: do not confuse with "node" meaning "network host". For user's benefits, we use the term " <a href="">document</a> " as this is the nearest term outside the hypertext world. </dd>
<dt>Protection</dt>
    <dd>The prevention of unauthorized users from reading, or writing, a particular piece of data. Also known as "authentication", "access control", etc. (<a href="">More</a>...) </dd>
<dt>Path</dt>
    A<dd>n ordered set of nodes or anchors which represent a sequence in which a <a href="">web</a> can be read. A path may represent the sequence a reader actually used, or may be a sequence recommened to the reader by the author. </dd>
<dt>Reader</dt>
    <dd>We have used this term for the person who browses, to distinguish him/her from the program ( <a href="">browser</a> ) which (s)he uses. </dd>
<dt>Server</dt>
    <dd>A program which provides a service to another, known as the <a href="">client</a> . In a <a href="">hypertext</a> system, a server will provide hypertext information to a browser . See also: daemon .</dd> 
<dt>Tracing</dt>
    <dd>The automatic finding of nodes by automatic navigation . Examples might be finding all nodes dependent on another node, all people interested in a given node, all modules which use a given module. Another example is a trace starting with more than one node, such as to find a node in common between two groups, or path linking two nodes. </dd>
<dt>Topology</dt>
    <dd>The allowable connectivity between nodes, anchors and links: for example, 1-1 or many-1 mappings. (More...) </dd>
<dt>Versioning</dt>
    <dd>The storage and management of previous versions of a piece of information, for security, diagnostics, and interest. This is important when many users are allowed to edit the same material. (More...) </dd>
<dt>Web</dt>
    <dd>A set of nodes interconnected by links . Often, the set of all the nodes which are interconnected. See also Topology .</dd>
